# HPCclusterscripts

These scripts were written for Hoffman2 Computing Cluster at UCLA with various purposes, some of which are:

- Job submission code for Gaussian16 software: automates job submission with a simple one line command
- Retrieving amount of memory and CPU usage of active jobs on houk nodes (our research group's nodes on the cluster)
- Retrieving the above-mentioned data at certain time intervals
