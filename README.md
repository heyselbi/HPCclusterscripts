# Scripts for HPC Clusters

These scripts were written for Hoffman2 Computing Cluster at UCLA with various purposes, some of which are:

- g16.py: Job submission code for Gaussian16 software (automates job submission with a simple one line command)
- monitor.sh: Retrieving amount of memory and CPU usage of active jobs on houk nodes (our research group's nodes on the cluster)
- Retrieving the above-mentioned data at certain time intervals

This is intended for those that are interested and new to clusters, like me :)
Any feedback is very welcome.
