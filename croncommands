# some useful commands when setting up crontab
# crontab executes a job script at time intervals set by a user

# to show current active crontab command (if there is any)
crontab -l
# if none, it will say "no crontab for selbi"

# to edit the cron command
crontab -e
# opens up a new txt file where you write your one or few lines of crontab command

# For example, to execute your job script every 20 mins and save with the date, below is the crontab command
# you save in the txt file that opened from the above code
*/20 * * * * sh /u/home/s/selbi/monitor/monitor.sh > /u/home/s/selbi/monitor/jobinfo`date +\%Y\%m\%d\%H\%M\%S`.log
# in my case, my job scripts name is monitor.sh

# to check if your crontab code is running
service crond status

# Whenever an error with crontab happens, error logs are saved and can be found here (replace selbi with your username)
vi /var/mail/selbi
